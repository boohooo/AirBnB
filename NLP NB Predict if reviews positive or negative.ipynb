       "      <td>unfortunately i did not have a good experience with this host and apartment  first of all chase responded all messages on time and seemed opened to arrange details to make the hosting work and was sort of flexible with checking in and checking out times however the apartment it is not a place i would ever go again i was supposed to meet chase at his work to get the keys on the arrival day he did not show up at the time we were supposed to meet  i spoke to his coworker who offered to help fortunately he got in touch with him because he was not answering my messages and turned out that he was not there then chase sent a friend who arrived  minutes later to bring the keys finally we were taken to the place and the friend told us that they were not expecting us to arrive that day that they confused the dates once we got to the place the apartment was dirty and dusty that  living room floor and washroom floor really need to be cleaned there was just a couple dirty blankets with weird stains on the bed and there was not even a complete bed sheet set it was definitely not a bed i felt comfortable sleeping in i was told that there was going to be an air mattress as well but we could not find the pump to inflate it and it was kind of dusty in the washroom there was not hot water for taking a shower and the floor mat was gross in addition the garbage bins in the apartment were half full unfortunately i did not have a good experience in this apartment the location was good though you can go everywhere walking from that place but the fact that the host did not get the dates right he did not showed up on time to bring the keys and how dirty the apartment was made the overall experience not good we stayed there for a single night and we could not wait to leave next day it is not a place a would come back or recommend</td>\n",

       "37895  the host is easy to contact and accommodated me when i needed to leave my suitcase before checkin time other than that the small twolevel apartment was a disappointment it was difficult to find within the older motellike complex with no elevator i dragged my suitcase up and down the concrete steps trying to find it it was a super hot day in seattle but there was no fan or air conditioning in the apartment leaving the windows open for air compromised my privacy but i had to keep the blinds up to get a breeze dont expect the level of hotel care because this is an old apartment without fancy amenities there is no tv there was one bath towel the hand soap in the bathroom was used there were no ice cube trays to fill important on this ultra warm day it is located between a creepy alley covered with steel plates that make noise when driven on see other review and the parking lot lots of air conditionermachine noise came from the alley this was an expensive mistake on my part                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "43230  unfortunately my experience with the belltown apartment in seattle is very very disappointing   i hate to complain or write negative reviews however i have to do it the first this apartment we booked for  guests there is a king size bed for  people and for a third person  a very small tiny and narrow sofa that is good enough to have a short nap  when i called to a property management and told that the answer was  we can deliver a air bed for  delivery fee  why  we paid for a night  us  the second one there is no internet  we again called to the property managemnet and asked if there is a wireless or wired internet  the man on the phone saidhe would call to the owner and asked for a wifi password and log in never called  us back   the third it was very cold in the appartment  there is no an instruction or a guest info book or so  we at our own risk opened the hitters vents and eventually it was little bit warmer  one more thing the building is very old so it is very smelly    the next one we also paid a cleaning fee  but all hitters are dusty the last  but also very stressful the address of the building  is  bell street  and there should be a lock with an apartments key but the lock was attached to the  bell street buildings door  who knew it    to figure out all these issues i had to call to the property management several times by using my cell with roaming rate and now i can imagine my fido bill    stay away from this place  i am  a airbnb member since  i am not picky at all  but this time it was to much                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "49612  unfortunately i did not have a good experience with this host and apartment  first of all chase responded all messages on time and seemed opened to arrange details to make the hosting work and was sort of flexible with checking in and checking out times however the apartment it is not a place i would ever go again i was supposed to meet chase at his work to get the keys on the arrival day he did not show up at the time we were supposed to meet  i spoke to his coworker who offered to help fortunately he got in touch with him because he was not answering my messages and turned out that he was not there then chase sent a friend who arrived  minutes later to bring the keys finally we were taken to the place and the friend told us that they were not expecting us to arrive that day that they confused the dates once we got to the place the apartment was dirty and dusty that  living room floor and washroom floor really need to be cleaned there was just a couple dirty blankets with weird stains on the bed and there was not even a complete bed sheet set it was definitely not a bed i felt comfortable sleeping in i was told that there was going to be an air mattress as well but we could not find the pump to inflate it and it was kind of dusty in the washroom there was not hot water for taking a shower and the floor mat was gross in addition the garbage bins in the apartment were half full unfortunately i did not have a good experience in this apartment the location was good though you can go everywhere walking from that place but the fact that the host did not get the dates right he did not showed up on time to bring the keys and how dirty the apartment was made the overall experience not good we stayed there for a single night and we could not wait to leave next day it is not a place a would come back or recommend   \n",
